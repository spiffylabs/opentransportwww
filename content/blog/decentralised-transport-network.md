I started working in the transport industry 6 years ago and spoke with hundreds, if not thousands, of fleet owners on every continent and from several industries. I had chats with the drivers and always took their feedback onboard. They never took mine however, always saying my software products were too futuristic and not for the real world.

Today, established fleets that have been operating for several decades are closing down and going into insolvency. Although this is mainly happening to the private hire and the taxi industry, it can happen very quickly to any transport industry.

This industry is very important: Everything you buy, from food to clothes, is transported several times until it gets to you. A large percentage of the price that you pay is the transport cost. From the raw material stage, from the assembly line to the warehouse, from the farmer to the restaurant and from the restaurant to your door step.

Big international players with very deep pockets such as Uber or Amazon are attempting to control the entire transport chain. Their services are efficient, simple and smart. And they don’t face any competition.

What it means to be open and accessible?


<br>
##### Open

Open means everyone can access it with no restrictions.: You can access Open Transport API and know the availability of vehicles worldwide for free.


<br>
##### Decentralised

We are developing a decentralised connection that connects the world to vehicles, demand with supply. This means more work for the drivers and more availability for the passengers and clients.

We don’t control it, nobody does. Is on the Internet, on your servers and everyone’s servers.

<br>
##### Why are we doing this?

We have many reasons, but perhaps you are interested to know how we make money? We generate revenues from helping and facilitating the billing between demand and suppliers.

The advice I offered to fleets over the last 6 years but which fell on deaf ears is simple: Get together, connect, share supply and demand, but don’t give this control to one company that promises to do it for you.

If you work in the food delivery, taxi and chauffeur businesses, courier or any delivery business: Try our system, talk with us and your business can have access to the biggest transport network the world has ever seen.
