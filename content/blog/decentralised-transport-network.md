I started working in the transport industry almost 6 years ago and spoke with hundreds, if not thousands, of fleet owners on every continent and from several industries. I had chats with the drivers and always took their feedback onboard. They never took mine however, always saying my software products were too futuristic and not for the real world.

Today, established fleets that have been operating for several decades are closing down and going into insolvency. Although this is mainly happening to the private hire and the taxi industry, it can happen very quickly to any transport industry.

This industry is important: Everything you buy, from food to clothes, has been transported several times. A large percentage of the amount that you pay is the transport cost. Not just the final step when you receive the item from the warehouse, but from the raw material stage. From the assembly line to the warehouse, from the farmer to the restaurant and from the restaurant to your door step.

Big international players with very deep pockets such as Uber or Amazon are attempting to control the entire transport chain. Their services are great, simple and smart. And they don’t face any competition.

This post is about Open Transport - what it means to be open and more important than everything else: What it means to be decentralised.


<br>
##### Open

Open means you can own it and everyone can own it: We have built an amazing, fully-featured dispatch system that you can host and let fleets use as a service. You can start your own dispatch business for any industry today!

Your system connects to other systems with free integration: We don’t make a “cut” in royalties or commissions. The system is yours and you host it on your servers.

Everyone can contribute and help Open Transport to grow.

Our license is more open than Open Source!

##### Decentralised

We are developing a decentralised connection that connects all deployments and drivers, matching demand with supply. This means more work for the drivers and more availability for the passengers and clients.

We don’t control it, nobody does. Is on the Internet, on your servers and everyone’s servers.

<br>
##### Why are we doing this?

We have many reasons, but perhaps you are interested to know how we make money? We generate revenues from developing software. We charge clients for any customizations required and any help they may need. We also charge a small one-time license fee. We are growing and will grow faster to make sure we offer unique and innovative features.

The advice I offered to fleets over the last 6 years but which fell on deaf ears is simple: Get together, connect, share supply and demand, but don’t give this control to one company that promises to do it for you.

If you work in the food delivery, taxi and chauffeur businesses, courier or any delivery business: Try our system, talk with us and your business could have a technology that is innovating faster than any other.
