      <h5>Drivers Network</h5>
      <p>
        When you acquire the Open Transport dispatch software and mobile apps, you can connect to a worldwide network of drivers or recruit new drivers for your business.
        <br><br>
        Currently, we only have drivers for passenger transportation available, however we are expanding to offer couriers and courier cyclists for food delivery, parcel delivery and furniture removal.

    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h5>Own your software</h5>
      <p>
        We know how important it is to create software that you can own and host on your own servers and that is exactly what we've done!
        <br><br>
        You can acquire the Open Transport platform and all it’s tools, which can be adapted to any industry that requires drivers in the field and deliveries.

        The taxi dispatch system Shift uses a bespoke version of Open Transport. Shift fleets can connect to each other and share reservations, they can share drivers and create beautiful apps and websites for their clients.
        <br><br>
        The system is available as a cloud service that allows you to connect white-label Passenger Apps (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blue-passenger/id989769893?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueandshift.shiftpassenger" target="_blank">Android</a>), Driver Apps (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shift-driver/id909006040?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueandshift.shiftdriver" target="_blank">Android</a>) and a <a href="http://demo.shiftdispatch.com" target="_blank">booking portal</a> with a UX that is second to none!

      <h3>Why did we create Open Transport</h3>
      <p>
        Uber et al are monopolising the transport industries. These companies want to destroy regional and national businesses, and when successful pay less to drivers and charge clients more.
        <br><br>
        Open Transport allows fleets to join forces and share reservations and drivers, thereby helping them recruit new drivers, grow their operational area and get paid.
        <br><br>
        We generate our revenues from selling software and we never charge booking exchange fees. You own and host your software and can customise it to your industry and market.
        <br><br>
        Each software installation will connect using a public blockchain that is free and that we have no control over. Currently this connection is done using a proxy in the cloud but we are in the process of decentralisation using the public transport blockchain.

      <h3>How can I acquire this revolutionary technology?</h3>
      <p>
        You can buy the software for €10,000 and receive the whole source code and an unrestricted license. You can then have your in-house technical team work on any customisation required.
        <br><br>
        Alternatively, we can install and customise your apps and system for a monthly fee.
        <br><br>
        Owning your our technology will make your business more valuable as you are not dependent on a 3rd party provider and you can grow fast.
