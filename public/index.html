      <h5>Drivers Network</h5>
      <p>
        When you acquire the Open Transport dispatch software and mobile apps, you can connect to a worldwide network of drivers or recruit new drivers for your business. Currently, we only have drivers for passenger transportation available, however we are expanding to offer couriers and courier cyclists for food delivery, parcel delivery and furniture removal.

      <h5>Own your software</h5>
      <p>
        We know how important it is to create software that you can own and host on your own servers and that is exactly what we've done!

        You can acquire the Open Transport platform and all itâ€™s tools, which can be adapted to any industry that requires drivers in the field and deliveries.
